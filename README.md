# ‚òÄÔ∏è Clustering Solar Energy Production Zones

This project applies unsupervised machine learning techniques to cluster geographic regions based on their solar energy production characteristics. The goal is to identify optimal zones for solar infrastructure planning and energy management.

## üîç Objectives
- Segment regions into clusters based on solar energy output and related features.
- Provide insights for targeted solar panel deployment and regional energy policy decisions.
- Visualize clustering results with clear maps and graphs.

## Project Benifits
- **Strategic Targeting:** Identify regions with high solar energy potential, allowing for targeted sales and marketing efforts.
- **Improved Project Feasibility:** Streamline project planning by pre-identifying areas with historically high production for client proposals.
- **Data-Driven Decision Making:** Gain valuable insights into solar resource variability across the region, informing business decisions regarding project allocation and resource deployment

## üìä Techniques Used
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, feature normalization, and encoding.
- **Clustering Algorithms:** K-Means, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical Clustering.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Silhouette Score, Elbow Method.
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for cluster maps and patterns.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
