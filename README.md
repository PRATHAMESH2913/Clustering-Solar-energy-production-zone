# ☀️ Clustering Solar Energy Production Zones

This project applies unsupervised machine learning techniques to cluster geographic regions based on their solar energy production characteristics. The goal is to identify optimal zones for solar infrastructure planning and energy management.

## 🔍 Objectives
- Segment regions into clusters based on solar energy output and related features.
- Provide insights for targeted solar panel deployment and regional energy policy decisions.
- Visualize clustering results with clear maps and graphs.

## 📊 Techniques Used
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, feature normalization, and encoding.
- **Clustering Algorithms:** K-Means, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical Clustering.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Silhouette Score, Elbow Method.
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for cluster maps and patterns.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
